<center><h4.3>Hey everyone! My name is Andrei Villavicencio. I was born in New York City
and spent some of my childhood in the island of Puerto Rico.</h4.3></center>
<center>I describe myself as a person who is passionate about creating. I love sharing my inner thoughts and emotions with the world.</center>
<center>I believe that in life you can find inspiration anywhere that you go. I don't like to box myself as a person, so I have many hobbies.</center>
<center>I love fashion, designing, music, and fitness. All of those things are like therapy to me and I don't know what I would do without them.</center>
<center>On my website you will find art that I've worked on. Hopefully it inspires you to create. The world is waiting for your unique ideas.</center>
<center>Here are more photos down below so you can get an idea of what I am like! </center>
